        "### **Features**\n",
        "- **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of integers.\n",
        "- **Information Retrieval**: Provides insights about Hasnain, including his work, projects, and skills.\n",
        "- **Interactive Interface**: Allows users to interact by typing queries and getting intelligent responses in real-time.\n",
